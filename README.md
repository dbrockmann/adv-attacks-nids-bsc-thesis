# Bachelor Thesis: Attacks against Deep Learning based Network Intrusion Detection Systems

## Overview
This repository contains the bachelor thesis "Attacks against Deep Learning based Network Intrusion Detection Systems" by Dominik Brockmann. The work evaluates the vulnerability of deep learning-based network intrusion detection systems to adversarial attacks, assessing the impact of different datasets, model architectures, and attack methods.

## Summary
Cyber-attacks continue to pose serious risks to information systems, and while deep learning improves intrusion detection through better generalization, it also introduces a vulnerability: adversarial attacks that exploit minimal changes in input data to cause unexpected outputs. This thesis investigates how white-box, substitute, and black-box attack methods succeed against deep learning-based NIDSs, indicating that the underlying data characteristics contribute more to these vulnerabilities than the model architectures themselves.

## Further Work
This thesis has been further developed and refined. The updated code and extended research can be found in the repository: [now-you-see-me-now-you-dont](https://github.com/dbrockmann/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont).
